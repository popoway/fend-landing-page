## Introductions

The project is based on the starter code from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page), which has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. this project has converted the starter code from a static project to an interactive one. This is done by modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
